            The reason for the migrations were that Adobe XD did not meet our prototyping needs at the time and that Axure RP was limited in its design capabilities. 
            Third time was a charm and Figma was able to support our design needs.

            was visible which made it difficult to identify files by just looking at the design screens. With the cover, it is easy to 
            identify project files and their progress without having to click into the file.

            Approaching this project, I started by mapping the current user experience and making notes of pain points. I met with the 
            product owners to get feedback on my initial assessment and to ask any questions, then I created a low fidelity design of the
            revised process. Once I got approval on the low-fidelity designs, I fleshed out the high fidelity designs and added
            detailed descriptions about changes and intended functionality of the new designs. 
            Lastly, I reduced the design to a minimal viable product.

            I incorporated functionality to support the fact that the inventory data would now be imported automatically as opposed to 
            manually by the flight attendant, as it was before. The original designs showed input fields for every line item. The new 
            designs reflected an edit state with a numerical keyboard for each line item and a confirmation button for all line items. 
            This is shown in the first 2 screens in the bottom row of the Approach images above.<br/><br/>

            I experiemented with recording customer orders within the customer card and the seat map. The first 2 screens in the images in 
            this section show the flight attendants being able to view all the entree options in a drop down menu. Throughtout the process,
            I would talk to the product owners and the development team to ensure the designs aligned with their goals and that they could be
            developed properly. From these meetings, I learned that the development team had plans to integrate haptic touch features. I 
            implemented that feature in my designs by having The flight attendants be able to view more information about an entree and 
            select it by pressing and holding that line item as shown in screen 3. Since there weren't many entree options, they were 
            displayed in an accordian list. However, displaying and selecting the drinks in the same manner would not be as efficient. 
            Therefore, the list of drinks is accompanied by a search bar filter as shown in the bottom row of the images in this section.
            The draft designs include descriptions under the frames that describe their intended interactions.

            several entry points into a customer card, senarios of whether a person has pre-selected a meal, and different 
            functionally of the iPhone like haptic touch. I also created designs for the minimal viable product, MVP.

            When drafting the designs, I created 1-3 options for each feedback session. Oftentimes when presenting multiple options, I

            updated iconography, I opted to replace the paper airplane and pilot hat icons, indicating the that the report was sent to the
            pilot and recieved by the pilot, with the words sent and recieved. I considered using double check marks but ultimately went with
            the words for clarity. Lastly, date section headers were added to improve information heirarchy as shown in the third screen in

            I met with the product owners of all the apps that my team supported to talk about what they wanted to highlight in each of 
            the video demos. 
            After creating a draft of each script, I made a rough draft of my idea for the structure of the videos. I used text to speech 
            software, a stock image, and screenshots to create a first draft of the videos. This video puts the rough in rough draft, but 
            it gets the job done. 
            I learned that the scenes with the screenshots would be better as a voice over. Having a voice over would allow realestate for 
            bullet points to better highlight the features of the apps in a visual way.

            When filming, we used a member of the In-Flight Services team, Anthony, who also was a flight attendant as the actor. We scheduled a full 
            day of filming where Anthony wore his flight attendant uniform. On that day, we used the inside of one of the training planes as 
            a set. I brought my tripod and set up a wearable microphone. We then recorded the intro and outro for all six videos. 
            Due to having only one day in Anthony's schedule to film and limited time for him to memorise the script, I used teleprompter
            software to display the script. We had set the laptop with thesoftware on a seat and filmed. However, it was obvious that he was reading
            something. To mitigate this, I propped my computer on a stool and some boxes I had found around the room. After filming the intros 
            and outros, we then recorded the voice overs for the features demo.

            To edit the demos, I used the iMovie software. I started by editing one full video with our recorded material and presenting 
            that for review. After recording and editing everything, there ended up being a change of script where we weren't allowed to say 'I'm 
            Anthony and I'm a Delta Flight Attendant.' This was hard to work around due to the way Anthony's inflection was when he was 
            talking and our time constraints. For the voiceover parts, I used screenshots and screen 
            recordings of the existing apps and made a powerpoint that included the bulleted points. Those slides were then imported into 
            iMovie and edited to be in time to the voiceover.

            I produced 6 videos 1-2 minutes long. Given the quick turnaround and last minute changes to the script, I am not as happy 
            as I could be with the results, however I am proud of myself for being able to adapt to the circumstances. <br/><br/>

            The Engagement Banner is used when the In-Flight Services team goes to conferences, to base visits for user testing events, and 
            to SkyPro support events. My team wanted to redesign the banner so that it would be more eye catching and to add a QR 
            code to recieve feedback. <br/>

            The original version of this design has no pizazz. The majority of the sign is navy with white text and it has no imagery. 
            The enviroment that the sign appears in is atop a table with a navy blue table cloth.

            When considering the redesign, one of my main focuses was to expand the color pallete. I focused on using the Delta brand 
            red and using more interesting geometry to create an eye catching option. I explored options that included red backgrounds and 
            using plane imagery.

            The final version has 3 main portions, the red header, the blue QR section, and the bottom portion that mimics a phone home screen.
            The idea was to have a sign that visually shows that we deal with phone apps and want you to interact with us via the QR code.
