                    A 2D animation created frame by frame for the Alpha Omega Epsilon recruitment. To incorporate
                    the monopoly theme, I animated the monopoly man's arms to be raised over his head and moved to 
                    in front of his body with his hands forming the Alpha Omega Epsilon symbol. The second animation 
                    is animating a dice roll. This was made for Instagram with the post dimensions in mind.

                    These info cards were designed to be table settings at a museum bird event. I was given reference images of the birds. I 
                    removed the background and took color samples of the original image to create a background that would make the bird the 
                    focal point of the card. For the back of the cards, I kept it simple to keep the discriptions legible. I tied the front of the
                    card to the back by adding the feather of the bird as a detail above the text.

                    I designed a poster to accompany the info cards. For this poster, I needed to communicate the instructions of the project for participants while maintaining a consistent design aesthetic. I incorporated all of the bird imagery from the info cards and a gradient background meant to simulate the birds perched in trees or flying in the sky. I also used the gradient to keep the design in line with the style of the info cards' color backgrounds. The goal of this design was to keep its elements simple enough that they wouldn't distract from the instructions, but also to keep them in harmony with the look and feel of the info cards.
