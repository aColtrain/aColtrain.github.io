                    <p>
                        Produced as a rapid-turnaround internal deliverable to align stakeholders on new passenger flows. To meet tight deadlines with zero departmental budget, I leveraged lean production tools including iMovie and open-source teleprompting software to deliver a functional, high-impact narrative demo.

            <h2>Commercial Motion Hero</h2>
            <p>Since you were paid by a major brand like Delta, this work needs the most visual weight.

The Look: A large, edge-to-edge video player at the top of the page.

The Detail: Use a side-panel description that explains you were a Delta Intern and produced this to visualize passenger flows for internal stakeholders.

The Tech: Mention the tools used (e.g., After Effects, Premiere, or Figma Motion).</p>
